This directory contains sample terrain data to make it easy to launch a server for testing.

There are two terrain file formats.

The first is a text file containing the letters M, G, D, W, and _.  Two
dimensional rectangles of terrain data can be defined by a group of lines
consisting of these letters into a terrain file.  Additional dimensions of
terrain data can be added below such a rectangle by adding a blank line and then
another similar group of lines.

The second is any image file which can be loaded by pygame.  The red channel of
the image will be used to define terrain height at each position.  This format
is still in development and doesn't produce very good results yet.
