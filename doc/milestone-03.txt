GAME MILESTONE THREE - TERRAIN
==============================

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION
------------------------

The player should be able to move over a world with scenery (such as
hedgerows and puddles).  The player should be rendered on top of the
scenery at the position he occupies with transparency.  Collision with
objects in the scene need not block the player's movement.


IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The terrain should be rendered based on a model which facilitates easy
placement of scenery and other world features and is conducive to a mobile
viewport.
