GAME MILESTONE FOUR - NETWORK
=============================

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION
------------------------

An instance of a game client should be able to connect to a previously deployed
game server.  It should be assigned control of a player such that it can move
the player around (see milestones 1 and 2).  Movements undertaken in this way
should be visible to other instances of the game client connected to the same
game server.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The server has model objects representing each player in the world.  Whenever
the direction of a player changes on the server side, the server informs all
clients who can observe that player of that player's position and new
direction.

Any player model object on the server can have its direction changed by a
message from the client who controls that player.

Each client has a model object for each player.  On the client who controls a
player, that player's model has an observer which relays direction changes to
the server.  All player models have a controller which relays network messages
about position and direction to the model.  Network information takes
precedence over local state.
