GAME MILESTONE ONE - WALKING
============================

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION
------------------------

A program should exist which displays on the screen a window
containing a background image and one sprite which can be directed to
move in eight directions with the keyboard.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The implementation should be based on the Twisted main loop and Pygame
graphics technology. The CPU should not be overly taxed.
