GAME MILESTONE TWO - MOVING GOOD
================================

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION
------------------------

Movement is possible with the arrow keys: left for west, right for east, up for
north, down for south, with pairwise combinations allowed for keys which are
not in opposite directions to move in the inter-cardinal directions.

When an arrow key is held and an opposite arrow key is pressed, movement should
switch to be in the direction of the second arrow key.  When the second arrow
key is released, movement should resume in the original direction, if the first
key is still depressed.  On the other hand, if the first arrow key is released
before the second arrow key, movement in the second direction should not stop.

When an arrow key is held and an arrow key on the opposite axis is pressed,
movement should change from the original cardinal direction to the inter-
cardinal direction between the two keys.  When either key is subsequently
released, movement should henceforth be in the direction of the remaining held
key.

IN OTHER WORDS DUMMIES, the direction of movement should always reflect the
currently held keys, with conflicting directions resolved in favor of the most
recently pressed key.
