INTRODUCTION:

This is a game.  It uses Twisted and Pygame.


RUNNING:

To run the game server, issue the command:
  twistd gam3

This will start twistd, the Twisted daemon, acting as a gam3 server.
By default, it will run on TCP port 1337.

To run the game client:
  ./bin/network-client localhost 1337

The network-client script assumes that the game source path is part of
Python's search path.  If you do not include the current directory in
your Python path by default, you will need to add it when running the
client.  For example, in a bash shell on Ubuntu:
  PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/network-client localhost 1337


DEPENDENCIES:

The game client and server depend on several packages.
 * Twisted - it's Twisted
 * Pygame - SDL graphics and sound
 * NumPy - numeric processing
 * PyOpenGL - accelerated graphics
 * Epsilon - useful utility package

Each of these can be installed using easy_install.  For information on
how to get easy_install, see:
  http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html

To install each of the prerequisite packages, run easy_install with
the package name as its argument.  For example, to install Twisted:
  easy_install twisted
or, on UNIX-like systems:
  sudo easy_install twisted  # To install for all users.
